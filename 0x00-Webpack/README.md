This project contains tasks designed to help you learn how to use Webpack, a powerful module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. The tasks progressively build up from basic setup to more advanced features like CSS handling, image optimization, and setting up a development server.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Basic Setup

**Objective:**  
Set up a basic Webpack installation and create a simple webpage that uses jQuery to add elements to the page.

**Steps:**
1. Create a folder named `task_0`.
2. Install Webpack and Webpack CLI as development dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
   ```
3. Install jQuery as a regular dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install jquery
   ```
4. Ensure that `webpack` and `webpack-cli` are listed under `devDependencies` and `jquery` under `dependencies` in `package.json`.
5. Create a `src` directory with an `index.js` file:
   - Import jQuery.
   - Add three paragraphs to the body of the HTML:
     1. "Holberton Dashboard"
     2. "Dashboard data for the students"
     3. "Copyright - Holberton School"
6. Create a `dist/index.html` file and import your `main.js` in the body.
7. Run Webpack to generate the necessary files in the `dist` folder.
8. Ensure your HTML file only imports the JavaScript file generated by Webpack.

### Task 1: Learning How to Use Webpack with a Config File

**Objective:**  
Learn how to use a custom Webpack configuration file to manage JavaScript dependencies and optimize the build process.

**Steps:**
1. Create a folder named `task_1` and initialize it:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install Webpack, jQuery, and Lodash:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack
   npm install jquery lodash
   ```
3. Modify `package.json` to add a build script:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "webpack --mode production"
   }
   ```
4. Create a `js/dashboard_main.js` file that:
   - Imports jQuery.
   - Adds elements to the HTML (paragraphs, button, counter).
   - Implements a function `updateCounter()` to track button clicks using Lodash's `debounce` function.
5. Ensure your generated JavaScript file is named `bundle.js` and is located in the `public` folder.
6. Verify that running the build command creates the appropriate output without errors.

### Task 2: Adding CSS & Images

**Objective:**  
Enhance the Webpack configuration to handle CSS and images.

**Steps:**
1. Reuse the code from `task_1` in a new folder named `task_2`.
2. Modify Webpack to support CSS and image bundling.
3. Create a `css/main.css` file to style the page:
   - Adjust the position and style of the counter.
   - Add a logo with an image background.
4. Ensure Webpack optimizes images and CSS.
5. Verify that running Webpack in production mode generates the appropriate assets without warnings.

### Task 3: Dev Servers, Modules, and Tree Shaking

**Objective:**  
Set up a development server and divide your code into modules to improve development speed and bundle size.

**Steps:**
1. Reuse the code from `task_2` in a new folder named `task_3`.
2. Modify Webpack to:
   - Set up a development server on port 8564.
   - Split the code into `header`, `body`, and `footer` modules.
   - Add plugins for automatic HTML generation, inline source mapping, and cleaning the build folder.
   - Optimize the bundle by splitting chunks and reducing the size of generated files.
3. Verify that running the development server works as expected and the production build generates optimized files.
